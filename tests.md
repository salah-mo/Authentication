## Test Cases for RAG Chatbot

### Initial Interaction

1. **Successful Chatbot Initialization:**
   - **Objective:** Ensure the chatbot initializes correctly when the user starts a chat session.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Open the chat interface.
     2. Start a new conversation.
   - **Expected Result:** The chatbot greets the user and provides a brief introduction or prompt.
   - **Severity:** Critical
   - **Reason:** If the chatbot fails to initialize, users can't interact with the system, rendering the chatbot unusable.

2. **Chatbot Not Responding:**
   - **Objective:** Validate that the chatbot responds within an acceptable timeframe.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Open the chat interface.
     2. Start a new conversation.
   - **Expected Result:** The chatbot responds within a few seconds.
   - **Severity:** Critical
   - **Reason:** Users expect immediate responses from the chatbot; failure here means the chatbot is effectively non-functional.

3. **Chatbot Greeting Message:**
   - **Objective:** Ensure the greeting message is displayed correctly.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Open the chat interface.
     2. Start a new conversation.
   - **Expected Result:** The chatbot displays a well-formatted and typo-free greeting message.
   - **Severity:** Minor
   - **Reason:** While less critical, a missing or poorly formatted greeting message affects the user experience but does not impede functionality.

### User Query Handling

1. **Accurate Information Retrieval:**
   - **Objective:** Ensure the chatbot retrieves accurate information from the database or knowledge base.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Ask a factual question.
   - **Expected Result:** The chatbot provides a correct and relevant answer.
   - **Severity:** Critical
   - **Reason:** The main purpose of the chatbot is to provide accurate information. Failure in this area significantly impacts usability and trust.

2. **Handling Complex Queries:**
   - **Objective:** Test how the chatbot handles complex or multi-part questions.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Ask a multi-layered or complex question.
   - **Expected Result:** The chatbot provides a coherent answer addressing all parts of the question.
   - **Severity:** High
   - **Reason:** Complex queries are common. Inability to handle them well reduces the chatbot's effectiveness, though simpler queries may still be functional.

3. **Fallback for Unknown Queries:**
   - **Objective:** Ensure the chatbot provides a fallback or alternative when it cannot understand a query.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Ask an unrelated or nonsensical question.
   - **Expected Result:** The chatbot politely indicates it doesn't understand and offers to help with something else.
   - **Severity:** Medium
   - **Reason:** The chatbot should gracefully handle unknown queries. Not doing so affects user experience but does not completely break the functionality.

4. **Handling Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs):**
   - **Objective:** Ensure the chatbot can correctly answer FAQs.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Ask a common question from the FAQ list.
   - **Expected Result:** The chatbot provides the correct answer promptly.
   - **Severity:** High
   - **Reason:** FAQs are expected to be answered correctly; failure here significantly impacts the chatbot's perceived usefulness.

### Conversational Flow

1. **Maintaining Context in Conversations:**
   - **Objective:** Validate that the chatbot maintains the context over multiple user interactions.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Start a conversation on a topic.
     2. Continue asking follow-up questions related to the initial topic.
   - **Expected Result:** The chatbot maintains context and provides relevant responses.
   - **Severity:** Critical
   - **Reason:** Maintaining context is crucial for meaningful conversations. Failure here disrupts the entire conversational flow, making the chatbot less effective.

2. **Smooth Transition Between Topics:**
   - **Objective:** Ensure the chatbot can handle transitions between different topics smoothly.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Start a conversation on one topic.
     2. Transition to a completely different topic.
   - **Expected Result:** The chatbot smoothly transitions and provides relevant information for the new topic.
   - **Severity:** High
   - **Reason:** Users may frequently change topics. Poor handling significantly impacts the user experience but does not entirely break functionality.

3. **Session Timeout and Reinitialization:**
   - **Objective:** Validate the chatbot's behavior when a chat session times out.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Start a conversation.
     2. Leave the chat idle for a set period, causing a session timeout.
     3. Attempt to continue the conversation.
   - **Expected Result:** The chatbot should handle session timeout gracefully and allow the user to reinitiate the conversation.
   - **Severity:** Medium
   - **Reason:** A graceful handling of session timeouts improves user experience. However, it does not prevent the chatbot from being used again.

### User Experience

1. **Handling Typographical Errors:**
   - **Objective:** Ensure the chatbot understands common typos and errors.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Enter a query with common spelling or typing errors.
   - **Expected Result:** The chatbot correctly interprets and responds to the query.
   - **Severity:** Medium
   - **Reason:** Being tolerant of typos impacts user friendliness but users can correct their input, so it's not critical.

2. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):**
   - **Objective:** Validate the chatbot's ability to understand and process natural language queries.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Ask questions in different natural language formats.
   - **Expected Result:** The chatbot provides accurate responses regardless of query format.
   - **Severity:** High
   - **Reason:** Misunderstanding user queries reduces the chatbot's effectiveness significantly, although users can rephrase queries.

3. **Multilingual Support:**
   - **Objective:** Test if the chatbot supports multiple languages (if applicable).
   - **Steps:**
     1. Ask a question in a supported foreign language.
   - **Expected Result:** The chatbot correctly responds in the same language.
   - **Severity:** High
   - **Reason:** If multilingual support is advertised, failure to deliver undermines the utility for users speaking different languages.

### Error Handling and Resilience

1. **Handling System Errors Gracefully:**
   - **Objective:** Ensure the chatbot handles backend system errors gracefully and informs the user.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Simulate a backend error.
   - **Expected Result:** The chatbot informs the user that there is an issue and suggests trying again later.
   - **Severity:** Critical
   - **Reason:** System errors are inevitable; handling them gracefully ensures users are informed and can retry later.

2. **Dealing with Unexpected Inputs:**
   - **Objective:** Test how the chatbot handles unexpected or inappropriate inputs.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Enter inappropriate or out-of-scope inputs.
   - **Expected Result:** The chatbot responds appropriately without crashing or hanging.
   - **Severity:** Medium
   - **Reason:** Handling unexpected inputs without crashing is essential for robustness but doesn't hinder normal use under ordinary circumstances.
